fix: prevent ColorPicker input from losing focus while typing

- Remove currentRgb and currentHex from useEffect dependencies
- These derived values created new object references each render
- Now only depend on primitive values (hue, saturation, brightness, inputType)
- Compute RGB/HEX inside useEffect to avoid stale closure issues
